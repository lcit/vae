# Playing with variational autoencoders

Traversing the latent space on NMIST. On the left, the TSNE 2d embedding of the much larger VAE latent space (6272 elelment vector). I have create a trajectory in the latent space that traverse all digits. The red point is the position in the embedding of the current latent vector beign decoded.
